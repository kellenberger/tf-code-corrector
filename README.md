# Deep Code Corrector

Deep Code Corrector is inspired by [Deep Text Corrector](https://github.com/atpaino/deep-text-corrector) by atpaino. It tries to apply similar ideas to the problem of error correction in source code.  

This code is based on the tensorflow [seq2seq tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq).
